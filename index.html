<p>Hi my name is Graham Hughes and welcome to my first website I built about the SCG.</p>
<p>This website was created when I first started learning about web development in late 2016. All of the website including the splash screen was about learning how elements work and how to make content responsive for mobile devices. Although this website is responsive in the mobile view it dose not look very good. Anyway ENJOY... </p>
