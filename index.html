<p>Hi my name is Graham Hughes and welcome to my mock-up SCG website.</p>
<p>This was my first full website I built when I started to learn about web development in late 2016. This website including the splash page was created for learning about putting elements into pages and how to make the content responsive for mobile. Although this website is responsive to mobile devices, in the mobile view the pages do not look very good and looks a bit squashed up. ENJOY... </p>
