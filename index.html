<p>Hi and welcome to my mock-up SCG info splash page.</p>
<p>This website including this splash page has been created for mainly puting elements into a page (including this audio file of CH9 theme) and making the content within it responcive for mobile devices. Although this website is responcive to mobile devices in mobile view the pages do not look very good and the information looks squashed up. Thats becouse the main focous with this website was puting elements in and making things responcive rather than design, this will be a focus in the next website. ENJOY... </p>
