	<b>3-6 January 2012</b>	
In the 100th Test played at the SCG, Australian captain Michael Clarke registered the highest ever Test score at the SCG when scoring an masterly 329 not out as Australia defeated India by an innings and 68 runs. After Australia dismissed India for 191, Australia appeared in trouble at 3-37, before Clarke and Ricky Ponting took control with a 288-run fourth wicket partnership.

<h2>The SCG info homepage</h2>

<p>Welcome to the SCG homepage, I have not put too much into styling this page but I did think of the layout a little bit. Ok if you haven’t noticed I created this page to look like wicket stumps, using the three columns in the middle of the page and the SCG top banner and the navigation are the pegs.</p>

<p>Although this page is responsive, the 2 images of Michel Clarke and Ricky Ponting are not. I had built out most of the website then decided to add them in. Most of the homepage would need to be redone to make them responsive as they also go out of there container areas. Styling is also needed to things like the navigation menu, The social network links to make bigger. A navigation menu button could have been added to open and close the menu when in mobile view. The main content area and the left, right sidebar needs to be collapsible in mobile view and be put on separate lines so text could be read easily. I will focus more on this in the next website.</p>

<p>There are only two other pages in the navigation menu the SCG history  page and the contact us page as creating them all would be much the same process. ENJOY...

<b>2-6 January 2006</b>	
Ricky Ponting re-wrote the record books when hitting twin centuries in his 100th Test match as his team crushed South Africa by eight wickets in the third Test against South Africa. Ponting scored 120 in the first innings and 143 not out in the second innings. Ponting became the first player to score a hundred in each innings in his 100th Test and along the way became the highest run scorer at the SCG surpassing Allan Border (1177 runs at 56.05), Greg Chappell (1150 runs at 63.89).
