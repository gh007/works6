In the 100th Test played at the SCG, Australian captain Michael Clarke registered the highest ever Test score at the SCG when scoring an masterly 329 not out as Australia defeated India by an innings and 68 runs. After Australia dismissed India for 191, Australia appeared in trouble at 3-37, before Clarke and Ricky Ponting took control with a 288-run fourth wicket partnership.

<h2>The SCG info homepage</h2>

<p>Welcome to the SCG homepage, I have not put too much into styling this page but I did think of the layout a little bit. Ok if you haven’t noticed by now I created this page to look like wicket stumps by using the three columns in the middle of the page and the SCG top banner and the navigation bar are the pegs on top.</p>

<p>Although this page is responsive, the 2 images of Michel Clarke and Ricky Ponting are not responsive as I had built most of this web page and I decided that I would add them, as a result I would need some or most of the homepage to be redone to make them responsive to mobile devices, they also go out of there container areas. Styling stuff is also needed to things like the navigation menu, The social network links could have been done bigger. A navergation menu button to be added to open and close the menu when in mobile view to give more room. The main content and the left, right sidebar needs to be collapsible and to be each put on seperete lines to make text bigger to be easily read. This stuff will be done in the next website.</p>

<p>I have only created two pages in the navergation menu up top the SCG historoy page and the contact us page as creating them all would be much the same prossess. ENJOY...

<b>2-6 January 2006</b>	
Ricky Ponting re-wrote the record books when hitting twin centuries in his 100th Test match as his team crushed South Africa by eight wickets in the third Test against South Africa. Ponting scored 120 in the first innings and 143 not out in the second innings. Ponting became the first player to score a hundred in each innings in his 100th Test and along the way became the highest run scorer at the SCG surpassing Allan Border (1177 runs at 56.05), Greg Chappell (1150 runs at 63.89).
